# AoC

I wanted to learn some Rust so I took [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) as a chance to do it.
Initially I started with the 2021 edition and then I refactored the project to manage any edition in the same place.
The solutions to the puzzles are in `src/bin/` and `src/main.rs` is a handy menu where each puzzle can be selected.
